# Task Workspace

This workspace contains two tasks, each in its own folder:

- `task1/`
- `task2/`

Each task folder contains an `index.html` and a `main.js` file.

## How to Run Each Task

1. **Open the folder in your file explorer.**
2. **Double-click `index.html`** in either `task1` or `task2` to open it in your web browser.
   - Alternatively, right-click `index.html` and select "Open with" > your preferred browser.
3. The JavaScript in `main.js` will run automatically when the HTML file is opened.

## Example

To run Task 1:
- Navigate to `task1/`.
- Open `index.html` in your browser.

To run Task 2:
- Navigate to `task2/`.
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
